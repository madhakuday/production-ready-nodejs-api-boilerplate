# 🧩 Node.js Clean Architecture Template

A simple and powerful Node.js project template with a clean folder structure and Docker support. Ideal for building scalable and maintainable REST APIs with MongoDB.

---

## 🚀 Why Use This Template?

- Clean and scalable folder architecture
- Easy to understand and extend
- Real-world examples: User ↔ Posts (1-to-many)
- Docker-ready for fast deployment
- Includes pagination, search, and MongoDB indexing
- Great for learning or starting a new project

---

## 📁 Folder Structure

- `/src` – Main source directory
  - `/api` – API routes and logic
    - `/auth`
      - `auth.route.js` – Route definitions
      - `auth.controller.js` – Request/response logic
      - `auth.model.js` – Mongoose schema
      - `auth.service.js` – Business logic
  - `/jobs` – Background jobs or cron tasks
  - `/services` – External service helpers (e.g., email, storage)
  - `/utils` – Utility/helper functions
  - `/validators` – Input validation schemas
   - `app.js` – Express app configuration
- `package.json` – Project metadata and dependencies
- `Dockerfile` – Docker configuration for containerization



---

## 🔐 Features

- ✅ User Registration

## 🐳 Docker Setup

### 📄 Dockerfile

```dockerfile
# Use an official Node.js image as the base image
FROM node:20

# Set the working directory in the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json to the working directory
COPY package*.json ./

# Install npm dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy the rest of the application code to the working directory
COPY . .

# Expose the port on which the Node.js application will run
EXPOSE 8000

# Command to start the Node.js application
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## 🚀 Docker Commands

### 🔧 Step 1: Build the Docker image
```bash
docker build -t my-node-app . 
```

### 🏃 Step 2: Run the container

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 my-node-app
```
